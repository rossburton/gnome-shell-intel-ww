Intel Work Weeks in GNOME Shell
===

This is a simple extension that monkey patches the _getCalendarWeekForDate()
function to use the Intel Work Week system instead of ISO 8601.

To install it for all users:

  sudo make install.

To install it for the current user:

  make install-local

To activate the extension you'll need to reload the shell, this is done by activating the
Run dialog (Alt-F2 by default) and entering "restart".

Note that showing the week numbers is a hidden setting.  You can enable it from a terminal:

$ dconf write /org/gnome/shell/calendar/show-weekdate true
